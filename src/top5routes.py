# for every driver:
# - collect all the actual routes carried out by that driver (from the actual.json file)
# For each standard route (id) (that has been implemented by the current driver):
# - get all the actual routes of the current driver that implement the current standard route
# - use minhashing to estimate the Jaccard similarity between the current SR and its related ARs
#   (after converting the two routes to sets).
#   (In case there are more related actual routes, average the similarities.)
# - Add the standard route id to a dictionary and set its value as the average similarity computed.
# - Keep the N (= 20) standard routes with the highest similarity scores.
# - On the N selected standard routes, compute the true average similarity to the related actual routes.
# - Keep the standard routes with the 5 highest similarities.


# The output should be in the following format:
