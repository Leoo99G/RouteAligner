# - collect all the actual routes carried out by that driver (from the actual.json file)
# For each standard route (id) (that has been implemented by the current driver):
# - get all the actual routes of the current driver that implement the current standard route
#   (In case there are more related actual routes, average the similarities.)
# compute the true average similarity to the related actual routes.
# - Keep the standard routes with the 5 highest similarities.


# The output should be in the following format:
#
# [
